Reaper, stay alert, a group of soldiers have stablished an output at this region, and many patrols are around the area.
We have to be quick, get rid of as many soldiers as we can, and then, repel the enemy reinforcements.
>Message Ready
Take all of my energy, and use the corpses i've been preparing at your will.
Start attacking the lone soldiers, and then, proceed to defeat the groups.

I need a second to show you something i've been preparing, don't worry, i'll come back soon.
>Message Spell
I'm back again, reaper, and this time, to show you how to cast spells.

Spells cost a lot of energy, but they can make a difference in battle.
I've only been able to research one spell, but i believe, it will be more than enough, this spell, disintegrate, &
is able to instantly kill a simple living unit, however, you won't gain energy nor corpses.

(To cast spells enter the casting mode ('C' key)) (Spells can be casted anywhere, but the cost is reduced to half if casted &
on your territory)
>Message Waves
The enemy patrols are incoming, prepare yourself for the fight.

(Finding the right combination of units and spells is the key to victory)
>Message Victory
The ground is now filed with dead bodies. Congratulations.
